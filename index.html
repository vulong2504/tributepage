        <h3>FILM REVIEW:</h3>
        <p>“Us and Them” is the perfect love story of passion for teenagers, but also for adults. I must admit that the
            romantic genre is not one I usually pay attention, but if the film is good, I don’t care about the genre or
            where it comes from. In this case, we are talking about a Chinese film directed by Rene Liu and starring
            mainly Jing Boran and Zhou Dongyu.</p>
        <p> It is a great romantic drama film that not only manages to entertain for 2 long hours, but also gets you
            very emotional. A film that makes us fall in love as it knows how to tell a love story with all its aspects
            and stages, as well as making us reflect on our ambitions and our goals. Maybe it’s not just one of the best
            Chinese films of 2018, but one of the best movies of the year, period.</p>

            <h3>PLOT:</h3>
            <p>The story starts on an airplane. Jianqing meets Xiaoxiao during a plane trip, a woman he is familiar with
                . The two look at each other from a distance and that’s when the memories of the past come to life. The
                story takes us back 10 years before this event, when these two young people met, during a long train
                trip. From there on, a very special friendship emerges between the two teenagers. He falls in love with
                her, but she at first does not feel anything for him, apart from friendship. Both are going to Beijing
                in a quest to find the life of their dreams. Jianqing aspires to prosper as a video game designer, and
                Xiaoxiao seeks to fall in love with a Beijing native, already installed in society. As they live
                together and fight for their dreams in a small apartment, they encounter the harsh reality of the big
                city and everyday life. Xiaoxiao engages in various relationships with different men older than her,
                which all result in failure. Meanwhile, Jianqing is frustrated in seeing how the girl he loves does not
                pay much attention to him. That’s when, at the most unexpected moment, the spark arises between the two.
